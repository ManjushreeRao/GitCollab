### Repository 

*A repository is a storage space. It contains all of the project related files and their file's revision history. Repository canalso be used to discuss, manage and track project's work. Repositories can be owned individually, or can be shared ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.* 
 
### Clone

*Cloning a repository means obtaining a copy of all the File and folder of the project in that repository at that point of time, from GitHub to our local system. This includes the version related files too.*

### Fork

*Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project, which means when you fork the copy of the repository you have taken remaining in you GITHub account only. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy.*
 
### Branch  
 
*A branch represents an independent line of development. The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.*

### Commit

*The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Commits include lots of metadata in addition to the contents and message, like the author, timestamp, and more.*

### Merge

*Merge is a way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. ... The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected.*
